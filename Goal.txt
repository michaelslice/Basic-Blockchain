Goal: Create a digital ledger that can record transactions across nodes. It must be public and immutable.

Basic Info:

What is Bitcoin? It is a decentralized cryptocurrency, that operates using nodes in a peer-to-peer(P2P) network that
                 uses the Bitcoin protocol to validate transactions 

Definitions: 
	Nodes: A redistribution point, or a communication endpoint
	Peer-to-peer(P2P): A distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers
	Bitcoin-network: Set of rules that govern the bitcoin network

Supply:
	Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, making it deflationary

Halving: 
	Every four years the reward for mining a new block is halved. The purpose is to reduce the rate at which 
	new bitcoins are created thereby increasing scarcity. 

Bitcoin Wallets:
	A Bitcoin wallet is just software that stores your private and public keys and allows you to interact 
	with the Bitcoin network to send, receive, and store bitcoin
	Public Key: Cryptographic code, that is derived from the private key
	Private Key: Secret code that allows you to access your funds, must be kept private

Blocks: 
	Transactions are grouped into blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions, a reference to the 
 	What the Block Contains:
		
	
	Previous Block Hash: Hash of the last header block
	Timestamp: The time when the block was created
	Nonce: A value used in Proof of Work systems to verify transactions
	

Blockchain
	It is a decentralized ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions across a network of computers 
	previous block, and a proof of work
	Proof-Of-Work: Requires Bitcoin miners to perform a computational task to prove that they have done a certain
	amount of work.  
	Computational Task: The task involves finding a hash value that meets certain criteria. The hash is the result
	of applying the SHA-256 hashing algo to the block's data
